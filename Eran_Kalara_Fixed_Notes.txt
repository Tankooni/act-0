Updates:

Editted the Terrain.

Notes:

For the camera, when you are standing with your back to a wall, such as the cliffside, and you rotate the camera in front of you, you can see through the terrain. 

1. Is this something that has a natural fix once you finish the camera set up?

2. If not, is it an easy fix? Maybe nudge the camera or prevent it from going through terrain?

3. If not, then, uh. I dunno.
